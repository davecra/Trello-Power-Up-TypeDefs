# Trello Power-Up Type Definition

This is an open-source type-definition file for Trello Power-Ups. To use this library you can import this into your project and place it in a \types folder in the root of your project and then if you are using VSCode, reference it in your code, by placing this at the top of your client.js file:

```javascript
/// <reference path="./types/trello.d.js" />
```

## Versions

 - v1.0.1.20221122 - first drop (beta)

## Feedback

This is a work in progress, so please submit feedback to [Issues](https://github.com/davecra/Trello-Power-Up-TypeDefs/issues).

## Future

Very soon I will be adding this to NPM so you can install it from there as well. Just got to get a few more of the issues worked out and then setup the release pipeline, and vioa, I will be backj here with the instructions for installing using NPM.
